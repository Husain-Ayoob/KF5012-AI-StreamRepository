### Run Locally
If you want to run this locally, download files from this repository and extract them. Follow instructions from [here](https://youtu.be/9JH0LXGBRV8) to create an Anaconda virtual environment. After activating this environment make sure you install 'numpy', 'pandas', 'scikit-learn', and 'matplotlib' (as required by environment.yml) as well as jupyter notebook. Remember, you need to install these within the environment so make sure you have run 'conda activate environment_name'. You should then be able to open the notebooks on your computer.
